Hello,

We are Christopher & Naimoudine!

We are both currently students at the Wild Code School in the Full Stack Developer training.

This project was the first mini-project in the REACT part of the training course, done in a day and half and we are rather proud of the result <3

What we learned through our PokeFight:

- useState.
- useEffect
- SetTimeOut
- Components
- Nested Ternary operator
- Dynamic change of CSS based on our useState
- Debugging the code & fix the bug
- Use of multiple style.css
- Import data from a JS files
- And of course the Front_End

I am happy with this project, its result and the construction steps.

Step 1 :  HOW WE ARE GOING TO DO IT ? 

![excalidraw pokeFight](https://github.com/IChris2611I/PokeFight/assets/161328235/f190928f-42bf-4cca-9d81-603fa44fa7e8)

You can laught ;) 

Not the best way of doing the thinking step, but we learn little by little :)

Step 2 : BLANK PAGE !!!

=> Wait for 20 min of thinking : " Maybe we should do something else... "

Step 3 : DOING THE CSS

The most important thing we learn : Do one step by one step and do what you can, then go foward little by little => Never try to do the perfect thing from the start.

STEP 4 : THE WAR BEGIN !! 

Yeah.... The start of the war xD

We dont have something to show because the whole project is on this GitHub repo.

Enjoy and have fun ;) 

STEP 5 : WE DID IT !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

Yes, we did it and we are proud of ourselves.

PS : We wanted to implement the ability to switch between Pok√©mon with the 'Pokemon' button. However, the logic and time constraints didn't allow us to do so.

HAVE A GOOD DAY !
